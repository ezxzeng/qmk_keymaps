personal qmk keymaps repo

Setup inspired by [patrick-elmquist](https://github.com/patrick-elmquist/qmk-keymaps) but instead of building here, I just set the qmk home as the submodule directory, use my own branch of qmk_firmware where the relevant directories are added to the .gitignore, and use that as a normal qmk_firmware repo.
